# Anomaly Detection in Healthcare Providers
Rising healthcare costs globally pose a challenge for many patients in need. Fewer and fewer patients have the resources to afford quality treatment to alleviate medical concerns. However, shifty medical individuals immorally seeking additional financial gains commit healthcare fraud, taking away the money that may be put towards increasing quality of care and exacerbating the financial burden placed on patients and their families. 
## Why Care?
1. Fewer financial resources that could be spent on other areas such as education, transportation and social services
2. Moral issues in ethics and human context
3. Unnecessary healthcare procedures â†’ extravagance in money
## Research Questions:
1. How can we accurately predict fraudulent medical entries in terms of total payment amounts?
2. And what factors can be better outlier indicators?
## Methods and Process:
Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Regression are used in this project to first clean data, then visualize to create a general picture to the dataset, and eventually build models to do prediction and correlation analysis.
## Deliverable:
